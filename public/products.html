            Mobdub is a community engagement platform for professional media. Our goal is to help content brands engage
            their audience in meaningful and addictive ways by encouraging user participation and interaction. We provide
            a patent-pending suite of features that includes moderated comments, mobile applications to acquire and deliver
            content, and integration with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. Our video annotation tools enable
            captions, hotspots and news tickers to be synchronized with specific moments in time to create a dynamic
            viewing experience. The hosted Mobdub service aims to provide user registration and engagement across all
            platforms including PC, mobile, tablet and connected TV devices.

            A variety of textual annotations may be added to video using Mobdub’s tools, including captions and hotspots
            with corresponding tags and links. Annotations may be positioned anywhere on the video canvas and are
            synchronized to specific moments in time to create a unique and dynamic viewing experience. Captions allow
            publishers to embed rich information within their content, making video more descriptive and engaging.
            Hotspots make any object within a piece of video content clickable for extended browsing and purchasing
            opportunities. Publishers, consumers and even advertisers can be directly empowered to make video
            interactive.

            Mobdub provides a unique commenting system that synchronizes user posts with video content. Instead of
            viewing comments in the order they were received in a static list below a video clip, consumers can now
            watch comments unfold at the point in time other visitors intended to express their opinions. This approach
            makes comments more relevant to what is happening in the context of video playback. Each comment may be
            rated and flagged (if inappropriate) and a rich set of moderation tools gives publishers complete control
            over how the content is published. Visitors may share comments with one another so that the video begins
            playing at the moment in time the post was submitted. Our commenting solution also works for articles and
            other types of content in order to provide consumers a unified experience throughout your website.

            </div>
            Mobdub’s Twitter implementation allows publishers to channel the real-time energy of Twitter through their
            websites. Our Twitter viewer adjacent to your video player can be populated with your brand’s
            existing
            Twitter feeds or automatically configured to execute searches based on metadata such as video title. When
            users submit a Twitter comment we dynamically insert a link to the current video, as well as Twitter
            usernames and hashtags of your choice, thereby allowing comments to be grouped and retrieved for future
            visitors. The post is always created using the author’s own Twitter account. This approach initiates a
            virtuous cycle: as more people Tweet from your video experience, more people will discover your content on
            Twitter and follow the return links to engage with it. If one of these videos covers a hot topic and turns
            viral, you can easily narrow its Twitter parameters using our administrative tools so that the discussion
            becomes more refined and targeted.

            Mobdub allows users to sign-in using Facebook Connect, Twitter’s authentication system and OpenID (including
            Google and Yahoo). The system may also be integrated with your website’s existing registration platform so
            that consumers can continue to use the tools you already have in place without needing a new account.

            The Mobdub Administrative Site is a web-based system that allows administrators to manage application
            settings, browse content, and moderate consumer comments and annotations.
            <p>Browse & Manage Content – All the content available on your website for user interaction via the Mobdub
                tools is automatically linked to our administrative backend. You can view details about the video, edit
                video specific settings such as its Twitter configuration, navigate to a page where you can preview the
                video along with comments and annotations, or navigate to a page where all the video's comments and
                annotations may be browsed and moderated.</p>

            <p>Moderate Content – Comments, captions and hotspots submitted by your visitors are
                manageable
                via the admin toolset. Admin users may approve or reject content and the item will be updated
                on
                the public website accordingly. The system's profanity filter or community flagging may also be
                leveraged to
                help moderate content. Site administrators can define how content is published to the site based on its
                approval status. For example, the system can be configured to only publish Approved content if you plan
                to
                moderate everything. Conversely, the system can automatically remove any item caught by the profanity
                filter
                from the website.</p>

            Mobdub provides a custom-branded iPhone Application configured to pull content from any
            standards compliant web content management system. News, weather and video in addition to any category of
            content available in RSS format may be used to populate the application’s interface. For weather, the
            application displays current conditions, extended forecasts and radar images. Advertising may be served from
            any standard ad server.
