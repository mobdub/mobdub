	            Mobdub is an audience engagement platform for professional media targeting PC, mobile, tablet and connected TV devices.  
	            Our goal is to help professional content brands engage their audience in meaningful and addictive ways by encouraging user 
	            participation and interaction.  We provide a patent-pending suite of features including moderated comments and ratings, 
	            video overlays (captions, hotspots and links), mobile applications to deliver and capture content, and the ability to 
	            augment any media with social networking features from services such as Twitter and Facebook.

	            A variety of textual annotations may be added to video using Mobdub’s tools, including captions and hotspots
	            with corresponding tags and links. Annotations may be positioned anywhere on the video canvas and are
	            synchronized to specific moments in time to create a unique and dynamic viewing experience. Captions allow
	            publishers to embed rich information within their content, making video more descriptive and engaging.
	            Hotspots make any object within a piece of video content clickable for extended browsing and purchasing
	            opportunities. Publishers, consumers and even advertisers can be directly empowered to make video
	            interactive.

	        <div class="mdSectionText">
	            Mobdub provides a unique commenting system that synchronizes user posts with video content. Instead of
	            viewing comments in the order they were received in a static list below a video clip, consumers can now
	            watch comments unfold at the point in time other visitors intended to express their opinions. This approach
	            makes comments more relevant to what is happening in the context of video playback. Each comment may be
	            rated and flagged (if inappropriate) and a rich set of moderation tools gives publishers complete control
	            over how the content is published. Users may also share comments with one another so that the video begins
	            playing at the moment in time the post was submitted.
	        </div>

	            <div class="mdFloatRight"><img height="698" width="550" src="/images/platform_twitter.jpg" alt="Twitter" /></div>
	            Mobdub’s Twitter implementation allows publishers to channel the real-time energy of Twitter through their
	            websites. A Twitter viewer beneath or adjacent to your video player can be populated with your brand’s existing
	            Twitter feeds or automatically configured to execute searches based on metadata such as video title. When
	            users submit a Twitter comment we dynamically insert a link to the current video, as well as Twitter
	            usernames and hashtags of your choice, thereby allowing comments to be grouped and retrieved for future
	            visitors. The post is always created using the author’s own Twitter account. This approach initiates a
	            virtuous cycle: as more people Tweet from your video experience, more people will discover your content on
	            Twitter and follow the return links to engage with it. If one of these videos covers a hot topic and turns
	            viral, you can easily narrow its Twitter parameters using our administrative tools so that the discussion
	            becomes more refined and targeted.

	        <div class="mdSectionText">
	            Mobdub allows users to sign-in using Facebook Connect, Twitter’s authentication system and OpenID (including
	            Google and Yahoo). The system may also be integrated with your website’s existing registration platform so
	            that consumers can continue to use the tools you already have in place without needing a new account.

	            The Mobdub Administrative Site is a web-based system that allows administrators to manage application
	            settings, browse content, and moderate consumer comments and annotations.
	            <p>Browse & Manage Content - All the content available on your website for user interaction via the Mobdub
	            tools is automatically linked to our administrative backend. You can view details about the video, edit
	            video specific settings such as its Twitter configuration, navigate to a page where you can preview the
	            video along with comments and annotations, or navigate to a page where all the video's comments and
	            annotations may be browsed and moderated.</p>
	            <div class="mdFloatRight"><img height="306" width="550" src="/images/platform_moderate.jpg" alt="Twitter" /></div>
	            <p>Moderate Content - Comments, captions and hotspots that have been submitted by your visitors are manageable
	            via the admin toolset. Admin users may manually approve or reject content and the item will be updated on
	            the public website accordingly. The system's profanity filter or community flagging may also be leveraged to
	            help moderate content. Site administrators can define how content is published to the site based on its
	            approval status. For example, the system can be configured to only publish Approved content if you plan to
	            moderate everything. Conversely, the system can automatically remove any item caught by the profanity filter
	            from the website.</p>

	            Mobdub provides custom-branded iPhone and Android applications configured to pull content from any standards 
	            compliant web content management system. News, weather and video in addition to any category of content available 
	            in RSS format may be used to populate content.  Push notifications are available and advertising may be served 
	            from any standard ad server.  High resolution photo and video capture can also be enabled to facilitate remote 
	            publishing and user generated workflows.
